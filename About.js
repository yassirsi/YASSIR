        Parking is a significant aspect of urban planning and transportation management. With the increase in the number of vehicles on the roads, finding a parking space has become a challenging task for many drivers. Efficient parking management systems are essential to 
        ensure that vehicles are parked safely and securely, and that traffic congestion is minimized. The concept of parking has evolved over the years, with various types of parking solutions being implemented to 
        cater to the growing demand. Some common types of parking include on-street parking, off-street parking, and multi-level parking facilities. On-street parking refers to the parking of vehicles on the sides of the road. It is a common practice in  urban areas where space is limited. On-street parking can be either parallel or angled, depending on the width of the road and the availability of space. While on-street parking is convenient for short-term parking needs, it can contribute to traffic congestion and pose safety risks to pedestrians and other road users. Multi-level parking facilities are becoming increasingly popular in densely populated urban areas. These structures provide a large number of parking spaces within a limited footprint by stacking vehicles vertically. Multi-level parking garages can be either automated or manual. Automated parking systems use advanced technology to park and retrieve vehicles without human intervention, while manual systems require drivers to park their vehicles themselves In addition to these traditional parking solutions, there are also innovative parking technologies being developed to address the challenges of modern-day parking. Smart parking systems, for example, use sensors and real-time data to guide drivers to available parking spaces. These systems can help reduce the time spent searching for parking and improve overall traffic flow. Another innovative solution is the use of mobile apps and online platforms to reserve parking spaces in advance. These apps allow drivers to book a parking spot before reaching their destination, ensuring that they have a guaranteed space to park. This can be particularly useful in busy urban areas where parking spaces are in high demand. Efficient parking solutions are necessary to ensure that vehicles are parked safely and securely, and that traffic congestion is minimized. With the continued growth of urban populations and the number of vehicles on the roads, the need for innovative and effective parking solutions will only increase. By leveraging technology and adopting smart parking systems, cities can improve their parking management and create a more sustainable and efficient transportation network.
